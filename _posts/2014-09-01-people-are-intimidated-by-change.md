The majority of people are intimidated by change. Why? Because change challenges us to do something different; it forces us out of our comfort zone.

There’s an expression in sports, “it’s not how you play at home, it’s how you play on the road.” For the sake of this expression, let’s assume we’re talking about baseball. What the expression is saying is that it is easy to play in the comfort of your own baseball stadium; however, what happens when you go on the road? On the road you’ll be faced with challenges like the long backstop at Dodger Stadium, the Green Monster at Fenway Park, or center field at Minute Maid Park? These are all obstacles that you aren’t normally faced with at your own baseball stadium. Therefore, playing well on the road is all predicated on how well you can adapt to change. The same is true for working in a corporate environment. Companies are constantly changing ideologies, and workflows. You have to be able to quickly adapt to the changes. Today, I want to share with you some of my thoughts on change and navigating the professional workplace.

## Embrace Change

Face it, the world is constantly changing. This week’s piece of technology is already old news. I’m not saying that you should adopt every latest and greatest contribution in your field, but you should definitely be paying attention. For example, if you notice that the majority of your co-workers have made the transition from using your company’s old support forum to the new knowledge management system, then maybe it is time for you to follow lead.

In most cases, people are unwilling to makes changes in their current workflow because they’re convinced it will take them too long to learn or they’re convinced their way of doing things is easier. However, as much as we don’t like to admit it, change can expose us to new things, help us grow professionally, and teach us how to do things better. Don’t be the person that is unwilling to try something different. If you aren’t willing to embrace change, then change will blow right past you and you will get left behind.

## It’s All About Exposure

When stepping into a new work environment, it is easy to get frustrated as you try to learn the reigns. On top of just the daily mental and physical challenges of your job, you will have new workflows, applications, and terminology you need to understand. Furthermore, what employee is going to take the time to teach you all that stuff? Often times, it’s up to you to teach yourself. This can be incredibly intimidating!

However, remember that you are a new employee. You aren’t expected to know everything on your first day. The only reason your new counterparts understand the workflows, the applications, and the terminology is because they’ve been there longer, so don’t be so hard on yourself. I’m guilty of this all the time. I will think to myself, “James, you were supposed to learn all of this in college, how can you be so stupid?”

Unfortunately, no matter what your previous experiences have been, nothing can prepare you completely for a new position. But that’s okay! Just be a sponge. Learn as much as you can as fast you can. Take advice from peers, welcome critiques, and give it your best. Remember, it’s all about exposure.
