When working with clients, sometimes it can be challenging to communicate. Often, clients might not be familiar with the latest technical jargon… and who can blame them? As fast as technology is changing, it’s a wonder that we can even keep up with all the new verbiage. Today, I want to explain the difference between raster and vector graphics.

## What is a Graphic?

To begin, I think it will be helpful to explain what is a graphic. A graphic is anything visual, and since we are in the realm of technology; specifically, a graphic is anything visual seen on a digital screen. A graphic could be a photograph, clip art, logo, icon, or even a font. Why are graphics important? Well, I like to think that the phrase, “you eat with your eyes first,” can also be applied in a similar fashion with how users digest technology. Users like to see graphics! No one wants to just see a wall of text. Okay, so now that we know what defines a graphic, what is different between raster and vector graphics?

## Raster Graphics

A raster graphic is an image that is made up hundreds of thousands of little dots known as pixels. These pixels each contain their own unique color information and when all pieced together in one image create a raster graphic. The most common raster graphic in the technology world is a photograph. Photographs are often incredibly rich, large images comprised of thousands and even millions of pixels.

## Vector Graphics

A vector graphic is an image that uses mathematics to draw lines, curves, points, and shapes. Another way to visualize vector graphics is to think of plotting a bunch of points on a graph and then connecting the dots to create an image. The most common type of vector graphics are logos and fonts. Since logos and fonts often need to be used in a varying amount of sizes, it makes them the perfect candidates for vector graphics. I will explain why in the next paragraph.

## What’s the difference?

The two biggest differences between raster and vector graphics are scalability and the applications used to create/edit these graphics. What do I mean by scalability? With raster graphics, because they are made up of pixels, designers are metaphorically handcuffed if they want to make the image larger. Because raster graphics have a set amount of pixels; when you enlarge the image, the computer does its best job to compensate for the new pixels that must be created. This results in a image that is blurry and grainy, or better known as pixelated; notice the image above. However, with vector graphics this is not the case! Because vector graphics are composed of “points on a graph,” the computer can actually mathematically scale the image with 100% accuracy smaller or larger. This explains why logos and fonts are good candidates for vector graphics; notice the image below.

The second difference has to do with the tools used when working with either raster or vector graphics. Typically, vector graphics are created using programs like Adobe Illustrator or CorelDRAW and raster graphics are created using programs like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or Corel PHOTO-PAINT. I say typically because sometimes the programs can cross between different realms. But for the most part, these are the programs used by your day-to-day designers and artists.

## File formats

One last thing to pay attention to are the file formats used by raster and vector graphics. Raster graphics use file formats like .jpg/.jpeg, .png, or .gif. Also, .psd files are Photoshop files that are used to edit/modify raster images. Vector graphics use file formats like .eps, .ai, or .pdf. These file formats contain the mathematical information (“points on a graph”) needed to create vector graphics.
